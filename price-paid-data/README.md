## What tools are available
1. The `pp-downloader` is a command line tool for downloading price paid data in **CSV** format

## How to run the downloader
The general format for running this script is:

```price-paid-downloader.py <type-of-data> -s [start-year] -e [end-year]```

The date is optional and will default to the current year. You can pass in a date range of several years and it will download the yearly files for that period. To download a single specific year, just specify the start year only.

All the dates should be in **YYYY** format and files are downloaded in **CSV** format.

If you get a 404 error, it generally means the data for that period is not available.

You can also run the help option at anytime:

```price-paid-downloader.py --help```

**C** - Changed records: records changed in the price paid dataset in the monthly refresh. You should replace or update records in any stored data using the unique identifier to recognise them
