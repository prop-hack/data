# UK House Price Index Data
This data is taken from [Land Registry Public Data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-land-registry-data/public-data "Land Registry") and is meant to provide developers with an easy single place and programmatic access to the data as well as schema guidelines to store and process them.

The UK House Price data shows changes in the value of residential properties across the UK. The HPI is calculated based on the actual sold value (after conveyancing) according to Land Registry, which differs from others who may base it on asking prices.

## What tools are available
1. The `hpi-downloader` is a command line tool for downloading different HPI data in **CSV** format

## How to run the downloader
The general format for running this script is:

```hpi-downloader.py <type-of-data> -p [published]```

The type is required, running help will show you the supported types of data you can download.

The published date is optional and if not provided it will default to one (check the script help command). This date value usually means all data up to the published date has been used to produce the HPI data.

All the dates should be in **YYYY-MM** format and files are downloaded in **CSV** format.

If you get a 404 error, it generally means the data for that period is not available.

You can also run the help option at anytime:

```trans-downloalder.py --help```
